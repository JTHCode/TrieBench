# Walking through my thought process for creating this project #

## Planning: ##
  * Decide what metrics and sub-metrics to test
  * Plan out out what specific operations/methods to implement in Trie classes
  * Define different work loads to perform tests with
  * Draft format and storage plans for the official test results
  * Choose which types of data visualizations will be best for project

## Execution: ##
  * Start with creating standard Trie class and implementing chosen methods
  * Add detailed docstring and function definitions
  * Create and run test_cases.py and peform various functionality tests on data structure
  * Revise data structure code based on test case results until perfect score is achieved
  * Repeat previous steps for Compressed Trie
  * Create and run metric_tests.py to confirm accuracy and reliability of metric tests
  * Create benchmarks.py to run official tests and store results as previously decided.
  * Create data_visuals.py to analyze test results and output chosen data visualizations
  * Incorperate findings and graphs in Streamlit
